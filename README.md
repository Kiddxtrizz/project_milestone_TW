# Milestone Project
This project is a part of the [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/) milestone project day 10 of 12 challenge. 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The power of the web comes from building dynamic websites (also known as a "web server"). Your final project will require a basic website to display the results. These usually consist of three main parts:

   1. A database to store the data
   2. A middle layer of code that handles the "business logic" of the website
   3. HTML which is rendered to the user

Amongst the number of "frameworks" for building web servers, Python Flask is probably the simplest to learn.

Recently, however, libraries like Streamlit have made it possible to build simple applications without handling the web framework directly. They simplify the development cycle, but offer limited functionality and customization as compared to Flask.
 

### Methods Used
* Data Wrangling
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
* App Development
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Bash
* PostGres
* Pandas, jupyter, requests, json, datetime
* Heroku
* Streamlit
* Plotly
* VScode

## Project Description
Create a Streamlit app on Heroku that accepts a stock ticker input from the user and plots closing price data for one month (one of your choosing or perhaps one chosen by the user). 

- The first step of the project required obtaining an API to produce the information necessary
  * I went with [VantageAPI](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
- The next step involved preparing a wireframe of the application layout and visualizations. Additionally, develop user persona(s) of individuals that may use the site.   

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- writeup/reporting
- version control/Maintainence

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/Kiddxtrizz/project_milestone_TW) within this repo.
3. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r 'requirements.txt'`
4. Review [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference)
5. Review [Plotly Documentation](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/)
